# SHARE for Parking Availability Prediction using Pytorch
This is a Pytorch implementation of SHARE architecture as described in the paper [Semi-Supervised Hierarchical Recurrent Graph Neural Network for City-Wide Parking Availability Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.10516).

### The code will be updated soon...
